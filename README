DataSift Embedded - C Componant

This is a really simple C program that will be invoked by a PHP script via exec to turn 
on and off a series of FPGA controlled LEDs.

In a world where I could write decent code maybe the PHP side of things would be completely 
removed and everything would be written in C.

Who knows.
